"""Enhanced gzip library to support multiple member gzip files.

GZIP has an interesting property that contatination of mutliple gzip files is a valid gzip file. 
In other words, a gzip file can have multiple members, each individually gzip 
compressed. The members simply appear one after another in the file, with no 
additional information before, between, or after them.

See GZIP RFC for more information.

http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc-gzip.html

This library provides support for creating and reading multi-member gzip files.
